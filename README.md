# sql-mandelbrot-benchmark
**Because why benchmark sql engines with boring aggregates when you can generate fractals?**

This project uses recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE) to calculate the Mandelbrot set entirely 
in SQL ‚Äî no loops, no procedural code, just pure SQL. It serves as a fun and visually appealing benchmark 
for testing recursive query performance, floating-point precision, and computational capabilities of SQL engines.

## What is This?

A benchmark suite that:
- Computes the famous [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) using SQL recursive CTEs
- Tests multiple SQL engines, currently just DuckDB and a Python implementation for reference.
- Generates beautiful fractal images as proof of correct computation
- Reveals which database / SQL engine renders infinity fastest

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duckbrot.git
cd duckbrot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the benchmark suite
python main.py
```

## Current Benchmark Results

Current results on 1400x800 pixels, 256 max iterations, Macbook Pro M4 Max:

| üèÜ | Engine/Implementation        | Time (ms) | Relative Performance |
|----|------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1  | NumPy (vectorized, unrolled) |   665 ms  | **0.83x** ‚≠ê        |
| 2  | ArrowDatafusion (SQL)        |   797 ms  | 1.00x (baseline)    |
| 3  | DuckDB (SQL)                 | 1,364 ms  | 1.71x slower        |
| 4  | FasterPybrot                 | 2,850 ms  | 3.58x slower        |
| 5  | FastPybrot                   | 3,327 ms  | 4.17x slower        |
| 6  | Pure Python                  | 4,328 ms  | 5.43x slower        |
| 7  | SQLite (SQL)                 | 44,918 ms | 56.36x slower       |

**Winner overall: NumPy** - Just 17% faster than ArrowDatafusion using loop unrolling and vectorized operations!

**Winner SQL: ArrowDatafusion** - Incredibly fast, nearly matching optimized NumPy performance!

## How It Works

The Mandelbrot set is computed by iterating the formula `z = z¬≤ + c` for each pixel in the complex plane:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
  -- Generate pixel grid and map to complex plane
  pixels AS (
    SELECT
      x, y,
      -2.5 + (x * 3.5 / width) AS cx,
      -1.0 + (y * 2.0 / height) AS cy
    FROM generate_series(0, width-1) AS x,
         generate_series(0, height-1) AS y
  ),
  -- Recursively iterate z = z¬≤ + c
  mandelbrot_iterations AS (
    SELECT x, y, cx, cy, 0.0 AS zx, 0.0 AS zy, 0 AS iteration
    FROM pixels

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
      x, y, cx, cy,
      zx * zx - zy * zy + cx AS zx,
      2.0 * zx * zy + cy AS zy,
      iteration + 1
    FROM mandelbrot_iterations
    WHERE iteration < max_iterations
      AND (zx * zx + zy * zy) <= 4.0
  )
SELECT x, y, MAX(iteration) AS depth
FROM mandelbrot_iterations
GROUP BY x, y;
```

The iteration count determines the color of each pixel, creating the iconic fractal pattern.

## Adding New Benchmarks

Want to test PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite or even Oracle or SQL-Server? Just:

1. Create a new file (e.g., `postgresqlbrot.py`)
2. Implement a `run_postgresqlbrot(width, height, max_iterations)` function (the DuckDB implementation is a good starting point)
3. Add one line to `main.py`:
   ```python
   BENCHMARKS = [
       ("DuckDB (SQL)", "duckbrot", "run_duckbrot"),
       ("Pure Python", "pybrot", "run_pybrot"),
       ..., 
       ("PostgreSQL", "postgresqlbrot", "run_postgresqlbrot"),  # New!
   ]
   ```

The framework handles everything else automatically!

## Configuration

Adjust the benchmark parameters in `main.py`:

```python
WIDTH = 1400           # Image width in pixels
HEIGHT = 800           # Image height in pixels
MAX_ITERATIONS = 256   # Maximum recursion depth
```

Higher values = more detail, longer computation time.

## Known Engine Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Works Great
- **NumPy** - Highly optimized with loop unrolling and vectorized operations (fastest!)
- **DuckDB** - Excellent performance, proper DOUBLE precision
- **Pure Python** - Reference implementation, just to have an idea how fast the database engines are
- **SQLite** - Works but significantly slower due to recursive CTE overhead

### Should Work (untested, please contribute ü§ô)
- PostgreSQL (with proper recursive CTE support)
- SQLite (may need query adjustments)
- others 

### Known Issues
- Some engines might struggle with support for DOUBLE precision and may use DECIMAL (not good for fractals, and lead to pixelated results)
- Watch out for type inference - explicit `::DOUBLE` casts are critical!

## What This Tests

This benchmark evaluates:
1. **Recursive CTE Performance** - How efficiently engines handle deep recursion
2. **Floating-Point Precision** - DOUBLE vs DECIMAL arithmetic accuracy
3. **Query Optimization** - How well engines optimize complex recursive queries
4. **Scalability** - Performance with increasing iterations and resolution

## Contributing

Contributions very welcome! Especially:
- New SQL engine implementations (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Performance optimizations
