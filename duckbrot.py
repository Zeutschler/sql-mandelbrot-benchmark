"""
DuckBrot Benchmark - Mandelbrot computation in plain SQL
Author: Thomas Zeutschler
License: MIT

This script is intended to stress-test the performance and
recursive computing capabilities of modern SQL engines.
It generates the famous Mandelbrot set entirely in SQL and
saves the result as a beautiful image. This reference
implementation uses DuckDB, therefore the name 'DuckBrot'.

Questions to answer for a given SQL engine and in comparison:
- Is the engine able to run the SQL Mandelbrot computation?
- How much time does it take?
- maybe (not tested here): How much memory does it require?

The Mandelbrot set is computed by iterating the formula
z = zÂ² + c for each pixel in the complex plane, tracking
how many iterations it takes for points to escape (|z| > 2)
or determining they remain bounded. Further details:
